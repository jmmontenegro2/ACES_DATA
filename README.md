Description: This program produces a report of the data acquired from the ACES QuestionPro. It takes an excel spreadsheet and prints out relevant data and
text to a dialog box (you should be able to copy/paste from it). The data reported here is assorted to appear similarly to the data report that will be 
submitted monthly as of 7/1/21. Simply search for the file you want using the auto-generated filebrowser, then wait for the program to convert your raw data to readable data.
